## You’re a DeeJay…

and playing your tunes out of your DJ-app. Suddenly the Track skips and you are remembering the last time it did exactly this. Gosh, the file is broken. But your DJ-app is not able to delete it from the HDD. It can just delete it from its own library and it will be back the next time your collection is imported again. Did you ever check the file location and deleted it forever?

You have full access to your music library in your DJ-app and every and each evening you are discovering some doublettes in your collection. But your DJ-app can’t simply delete some of them. Life would be so easy if it could do this. No doublette-finder is as effective as you are when it comes to sort out the best version and quality and delete the rest. Or do you trust any of them?

In both cases the solution is given by a precious little app: PLAYLIST2TRASH. You will start with setting up a new playlist for future deleting in your DJ-app. From now on you will simply drop any broken tracks and doublettes into this list right you find them while working. And when you find the time you will export this list into an m3u-file like for example MixVibes’ CROSS does with an ease. This list could be dropped into PLAYLIST2TRASH and all those named tunes will be deleted from the several locations of your drives. No more writing down the rows of filenames and single deleting. Just drag and drop and delete. Get your DJ-app updating the newerly broken links to the deleted tracks and you made a new step in quality. Save hours of monkey business with PLAYLIST2TRASH.
